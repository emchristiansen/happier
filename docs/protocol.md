# Protocol

This document describes the Happier wire protocol as implemented in `apps/server`. The protocol is intentionally small: JSON over HTTP for reads/actions and Socket.IO for real-time sync. Most payloads are end-to-end encrypted client-side; see `encryption.md` for the encryption boundaries and encoding details. For the full HTTP surface and auth flows, see `api.md`.

## Transport and versioning
- HTTP API: JSON requests/responses on `/v1` and `/v2` routes.
- WebSocket: Socket.IO server at path `/v1/updates` (transports: websocket, polling).
- CORS: `*` (server-side).

## Protocol design motivations
The protocol is designed to stay minimal, explicit, and resilient under intermittent connectivity. A few guiding principles shape naming, payloads, and versioning:

- **Small surface area over completeness.** Routes and events exist only when they provide a clear sync primitive (e.g., sessions, artifacts, KV). If a capability can be expressed as data within an existing primitive, it should be.
- **Explicit event types and short keys.** Update payloads use `t` for the event type and concise field names (`sid`, `id`, `seq`) to keep message size down without hiding meaning. These names are stable because they are used across clients.
- **Separation of persistent vs. ephemeral.** Anything that must be recoverable after reconnect is an `update` event with a sequence number. Presence and usage are `ephemeral` to avoid state confusion and minimize storage.
- **Monotonic ordering at the user level.** `UpdatePayload.seq` is a single per-user counter. This makes client reconciliation simple: apply updates in order and you are consistent for that user.
- **Optimistic concurrency by default.** Versioned fields (metadata, agent state, artifact parts, access keys, KV) require `expectedVersion`. This prevents silent overwrites and keeps conflict resolution client-driven.
- **Client-side encryption boundaries.** The server never needs to understand plaintext. The protocol therefore treats most payloads as opaque strings or base64 blobs, which keeps server logic simple and privacy guarantees strong.
- **Released compatibility over breaking changes.** Evolve released routes/events additively or through explicit negotiation and seam-owned translation; do not mutate existing wire semantics in place or create competing domain owners. Baselines, mixed-version directions, predecessor rules, and removal conditions are defined in `compatibility.md`.
- **Avoid full REST verbs.** Reads are primarily `GET`, while writes/actions are primarily `POST`, with `DELETE` used when the intent is unambiguous. We avoid the full REST palette because many mutations are not cleanly tied to a single entity or involve more than CRUD logic. Keeping to `GET` + `POST` (plus occasional `DELETE`) makes the client simpler and the protocol clearer.

If a new protocol field or event is proposed, it should answer: does this create a durable sync primitive, or can it be encoded inside existing encrypted payloads without expanding the API surface?

## Authentication
Most endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The same token is also used in the Socket.IO handshake. Full auth flows and endpoints are documented in `api.md`.

## WebSocket connection
### Handshake
Connect with Socket.IO using:

```
path: "/v1/updates"
auth: {
  token: "<bearer token>",
  clientType: "user-scoped" | "session-scoped" | "machine-scoped",
  sessionId?: "<session id>",
  machineId?: "<machine id>",
  publisherIncarnationId?: "<runner process id>"
}
```

Rules enforced server-side:
- `token` is required.
- `session-scoped` requires `sessionId`.
- `machine-scoped` requires `machineId`.
- `publisherIncarnationId` is optional. A session runner sends a random identifier generated once per runner process; on a machine-authenticated `session-scoped` connection the server records which publisher generation that incarnation registered, so `machine-session-runner-exited` can retire exactly that runner.

### Connection types
- `user-scoped`: receives account-wide updates.
- `session-scoped`: receives updates for a specific session only.
- `machine-scoped`: used by daemons; receives machine updates and emits machine state.

### Server -> client events
The server emits two event types:

#### `update`
Persistent sync events. Payload shape:
```
{
  id: string,
  seq: number,
  body: { t: string, ... },
  createdAt: number
}
```

#### `ephemeral`
Transient presence/usage events. Payload shape:
```
{
  type: string,
  ...
}
```

### Update event types
Field names below match on-wire payloads.

- `new-session`
  - `body`: `{ t: "new-session", id, seq, metadata, metadataVersion, agentState, agentStateVersion, dataEncryptionKey, active, activeAt, createdAt, updatedAt }`

- `update-session`
  - `body`: `{ t: "update-session", id, metadata?, agentState? }`
  - `metadata`: `{ value, version }` or null
  - `agentState`: `{ value, version }` or null

- `delete-session`
  - `body`: `{ t: "delete-session", sid }`

- `new-message`
  - `body`: `{ t: "new-message", sid, message: { id, seq, content, localId, createdAt, updatedAt } }`

- `update-account`
  - `body`: `{ t: "update-account", id, settings?, github? }`

- `new-machine`
  - `body`: `{ t: "new-machine", machineId, seq, metadata, metadataVersion, daemonState, daemonStateVersion, dataEncryptionKey, active, activeAt, createdAt, updatedAt }`

- `update-machine`
  - `body`: `{ t: "update-machine", machineId, metadata?, daemonState?, activeAt? }`

- `new-artifact`
  - `body`: `{ t: "new-artifact", artifactId, seq, header, headerVersion, body, bodyVersion, dataEncryptionKey, createdAt, updatedAt }`

- `update-artifact`
  - `body`: `{ t: "update-artifact", artifactId, header?, body? }`

- `delete-artifact`
  - `body`: `{ t: "delete-artifact", artifactId }`

- `relationship-updated`
  - `body`: `{ t: "relationship-updated", uid, status, timestamp }`

- `new-feed-post`
  - `body`: `{ t: "new-feed-post", id, body, cursor, createdAt }`

- `kv-batch-update`
  - `body`: `{ t: "kv-batch-update", changes: [{ key, value, version }] }`

### Ephemeral event types
- `activity`: `{ type: "activity", id: sessionId, active, activeAt, thinking? }`
- `machine-activity`: `{ type: "machine-activity", id: machineId, active, activeAt }`
- `usage`: `{ type: "usage", id: sessionId, key, tokens, cost, timestamp }`
- `machine-status`: `{ type: "machine-status", machineId, online, timestamp }`

### Client -> server WebSocket events
- `ping` -> callback `{}`

- `update-metadata`
  - `{ sid, metadata, expectedVersion }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", version, metadata }` or `{ result: "version-mismatch", version, metadata }`

- `update-state`
  - `{ sid, agentState, expectedVersion }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", version, agentState }` or `{ result: "version-mismatch", version, agentState }`

- `message`
  - `{ sid, message, localId? }`
  - Creates a new session message (encrypted payload) and emits `new-message` update to other connections.
  - In development, `{ ok: false, error: "transaction-unavailable" }` identifies a transaction acquisition failure before the write callback started. The runner retains the original `localId`, content and intent for its existing bounded retry. A required caller still receives a failure until a commit is confirmed. `internal` and other negative acknowledgements do not establish this no-effect classification.
  - A retry can find an already committed row with the same `localId`; its successful acknowledgement retains `didWrite: false`. Retry exhaustion leaves the commit unconfirmed and produces a file diagnostic.

- `session-alive`
  - `{ sid, time, thinking? }`
  - Emits `ephemeral` activity to user-scoped connections.

- `session-end`
  - `{ sid, time }`
  - Marks session inactive and emits `ephemeral` activity.

- `usage-report`
  - `{ key, sessionId?, tokens, cost }`
  - Stores usage report and optionally emits `ephemeral` usage for the session.

- `machine-alive`
  - `{ machineId, time }`
  - Emits `ephemeral` machine-activity.

- `machine-update-metadata`
  - `{ machineId, metadata, expectedVersion }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", version, metadata }` or `{ result: "version-mismatch", version, metadata }`

- `machine-update-state`
  - `{ machineId, daemonState, expectedVersion }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", version, daemonState }` or `{ result: "version-mismatch", version, daemonState }`

- `machine-session-runner-exited`
  - Machine-scoped connections only. `{ sessionId, publisherIncarnationId }`; both are required.
  - Sent by a daemon that observed the session's runner process exit while no other live local runner owns the session. `publisherIncarnationId` is the identifier that runner sent in its `/session-started` report and its socket handshake. The server retires the publisher fence only while that incarnation's latest registration on this server process still holds the session's current publisher generation and the reporting machine still hosts the session, so the session stops reading `active` without waiting for the presence timeout. It ends no turn. If the session holds a waiting activation request when this makes it inactive, the server sends that request's activation hint to the owner's machines again, as the presence timeout does.
  - A report for an incarnation that is not the latest registered one, including a predecessor whose successor has already registered, is rejected as `unmatched` and changes nothing. The record of registrations is in memory on each server process. When the receiving process holds no qualifying current registration for the incarnation (for example, the runner registered on another process, or before a restart), the report is rejected, as `unmatched` or, if that process's record is stale because a successor registered elsewhere, `superseded`; the presence timeout then clears `active`.
  - Response: `{ status: "closed" | "already_inactive", sessionId }`, `{ status: "rejected", sessionId, reason: "not_found" | "machine_control_unavailable" | "archived" | "superseded" | "unmatched" }`, `{ status: "retryable", sessionId, reason: "internal" }` or `{ status: "rejected", reason: "invalid_request" }`.
  - A server that predates the event ignores it. The daemon sends the report once, only while connected, and never buffers it. A runner that sent no incarnation is not reported.

- `artifact-read`
  - `{ artifactId }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", artifact }` or `{ result: "error", message }`

- `artifact-create`
  - `{ id, header, body, dataEncryptionKey }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", artifact }` or `{ result: "error", message }`

- `artifact-update`
  - `{ artifactId, header?, body? }` where `header` and `body` include `data` + `expectedVersion`
  - Response: `{ result: "success", header?, body? }` or `{ result: "version-mismatch", header?, body? }`

- `artifact-delete`
  - `{ artifactId }`
  - Response: `{ result: "success" }` or `{ result: "error", message }`

- `access-key-get`
  - `{ sessionId, machineId }`
  - Response: `{ ok: true, accessKey? }` or `{ ok: false, error }`

- `rpc-register`
  - `{ method }` -> server emits `rpc-registered`

- `rpc-unregister`
  - `{ method }` -> server emits `rpc-unregistered`

- `rpc-call`
  - `{ method, params }` -> callback `{ ok, result? | error? }`
  - Server forwards to the registered socket via `rpc-request` (ack-based).

## HTTP endpoints by area
See `api.md` for the full HTTP endpoint catalog and auth flows.

## Sequencing and concurrency
- `UpdatePayload.seq` is the per-user update sequence (monotonic) used for sync ordering.
- Sessions, machines, and artifacts have their own `seq` fields used by clients for ordering.
- Versioned fields (metadata, agentState, daemonState, artifact header/body, access keys, KV) use optimistic concurrency with `expectedVersion` and return a version-mismatch response containing the current version/data.
